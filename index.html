        <div id="tribute-info">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Baba Harbhajan Singh was born in the year 1941 in Punjab, India.
              He was a dedicated and disciplined individual from a young age,
              and these qualities would later serve him well during his time in
              the Indian Army
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1956, Baba Harbhajan Singh joined the Indian Army and quickly
              rose through the ranks. He served in a number of conflicts during
              his time in the army, including the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and
              the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Baba Harbhajan Singh was known for
              his bravery, leadership, and unwavering commitment to his fellow
              soldiers.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, tragedy struck on October 4, 1968, when Baba Harbhajan
              Singh disappeared while on patrol duty near the Nathu La Pass. A
              massive search effort was launched to find him, but his body was
              not discovered until several days later. It is still unclear what
              caused his death, but it is believed that he may have fallen into
              a stream and drowned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite his untimely death, Baba Harbhajan Singh's legacy lives
              on. Many soldiers who served with him claim to have had
              supernatural experiences involving him, which they believe were
              his way of communicating with them from beyond the grave.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the most famous stories involving Baba Harbhajan Singh's
              posthumous presence is that of his body being discovered in a
              dream. According to the story, a fellow soldier had a dream in
              which Baba Harbhajan Singh appeared to him and instructed him to
              go to the spot where his body would be found. The soldier followed
              Baba Harbhajan Singh's instructions and, to his surprise, found
              the body exactly where he had been told it would be.
            </li>
            <li>
              Another famous story involving Baba Harbhajan Singh's posthumous
              presence is that of his instruction to build a shrine in his
              honor. According to the story, a fellow soldier had a dream in
              which Baba Harbhajan Singh appeared to him and instructed him to
              build a shrine where soldiers could come and pay their respects.
              The soldier followed Baba Harbhajan Singh's instructions, and the
              shrine was eventually built. Today, it is a popular destination
              for soldiers and civilians alike.
            </li>
            <li>
              Baba Harbhajan Singh was also known for his strict discipline, and
              many soldiers claim to have had supernatural experiences involving
              him waking them up while on duty. According to the stories, Baba
              Harbhajan Singh would appear to soldiers who had fallen asleep
              while on duty and wake them up, warning them of the dangers of
              neglecting their responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Baba Harbhajan Singh's legacy extends far beyond his supernatural
              presence, however. He was a brave soldier who served his country
              with honor and distinction, and his memory remains an inspiration
              to many who serve in the Indian Army today.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the most famous examples of Baba Harbhajan Singh's impact
              on Indian society is the story of the "empty chair" at the
              Indo-China talks. According to the story, the Indian delegation
              requested that an empty chair be placed at the negotiating table
              in honor of Baba Harbhajan Singh, who they believed had played an
              important role in securing the region's borders and maintaining
              peace in the area.
            </li>
            <li>
              In conclusion, Baba Harbhajan Singh was a brave soldier who made a
              significant impact on Indian society. His supernatural presence,
              strict discipline, and unwavering commitment to his fellow
              soldiers have made him a legendary figure in Indian history. His
              legacy lives on today, inspiring those who serve in the Indian
              Army and beyond to serve their country with honor and distinction.
